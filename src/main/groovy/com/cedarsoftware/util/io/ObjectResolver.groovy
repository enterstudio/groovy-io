/**
 * The ObjectResolver converts the raw Maps created from the GroovyJsonParser to Groovy
 * objects (a graph of Groovy instances).  The Maps have an optional type entry associated
 * to them to indicate what Groovy peer instance to create.  The reason type is optional
 * is because it can be inferred in a couple instances.  A non-primitive field that
 * points to an object that is of the same type of the field, does not require the
 * @type because it can be inferred from the field.  This is not always the case.
 * For example, if a Person field points to an Employee object (where Employee is a
 * subclass of Person), then the resolver cannot create an instance of the field type
 * (Person) because this is not the proper type.  (It had an Employee record with more
 * fields in this example). In this case, the writer recognizes that the instance type
 * and field type are not the same and therefore it writes the @type.
 *
 * A similar case as above occurs with specific array types.  If there is a Person[]
 * containing Person and Employee instances, then the Person instances will not have
 * the '@type' but the employee instances will (because they are more derived than Person).
 *
 * The resolver 'rewires' the original object graph.  It does this by replacing
 * @ref values in the Maps with pointers (on the field of the associated instance of the
 * Map) to the object that has the same ID.  If the object has not yet been read, then
 * an UnresolvedReference is created.  These are back-patched at the end of the resolution
 * process.  UnresolvedReference keeps track of what field or array element the actual value
 * should be stored within, and then locates the object (by id), and updates the appropriate
 * value.
